* Introduction
  TCP/IP created to connect different network compositions, i.e. /inter/-networking
  Additionally,

  - facilitates communication despite loss of networks/gateways
  - support multiple types of services
  - accommodate a variety of networks
  - permit distributed management of it's resources
  - cost-effective
  - connect hosts with little effort
  - must be accountable

** Architecture principles
*** Packets, Connections, and Datagrams                 :datagrams:important:
    In the '60s, networks were circuit-oriented. Since then, we have:
    - *Packet switching*: 'chunking', allowing for multiplexing, resilience and
      better network utilization.
    - Some networks are *FCFS/FIFO* -- (efficient, but unpredictable; example
      ethernet) others have *time-division multiplexing* -- reserving time for
      all connections but may leave networks underutilized.
    - *datagrams*: a type of packet identifying source and destination.
      + Requires larger packets
      + Sets up dumber, simpler switches allowing a connectionless network.
      + Foundation for modern networks/internets/the Internet
** Design/Impl (OSI)

*** (|De-)Multiplexing and Encapsulation
    - Layering allows for *protocol multiplexing*, such that different protocols can exist on the same infra.
    - *Encapsulation* allows for wrapping data in protocol data units (PDUs), such that each PDU contains the next plus
      identifying information for it's layer (Such as ethernet MAC address, IP Address, or TCP port number).
    The combination of these allows for data to easily transition across multiple mediums as needed.
** Design/Impl (TCP/IP)                                           :important:
   Mostly the same as OSI but with layers filled in and added:
  +--------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
  | Number | Name              | Application                                                               | Example            |

** Designing applications
*** Client/Server
    Iterative (synchronous) and Concurrent servers, Peer-to-Peer, and APIs.
* Internet Address Architecture 
  Internet devices connected to a network will generally have 1 or more IP Addresses.
  +------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | *IPv4 Addresses* | - expressed in a four-tuple: like 123.456.789.012.                                                      |
  |                  | - IPv4 has 4,294,967,296 possible addresses                                                             |
  +------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | *Ipv6 Addresses* | - expressed in four-hexidecimal-digit blocks: like 5f05:2000:80ad:5800:58:800:2023:1d71.                |
  |                  |   Lack of digits in an IPv6 block indicate leading zeros -- the :58:800: above is actually :0058:0800:. |
  |                  | - IPv6 has 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible addresses                       |
  +------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
** Basic IP Address Structure
*** Class-full Addressing
    Classfull addressing was a scheme where the address space for IPv4 was
    divided up by the ARIN into separate 'classes', which dictate their size.
    Below is a table naming the classes and sizes. Note, these classes are
    out of favor in preference for CIDR.
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | Class | Leading Bits | CIDR (prefix) | Description | % of Total |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | A     |            0 | /8            | Unicast     |        50% |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | B     |           10 | /16           | Unicast     |        25% |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | C     |          110 | /24           | Unicast     |      12.5% |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | D     |          N/A | N/A           | Multicast   |      6.25% |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
    | E     |          N/A | N/A           | Reserved    |      6.25% |
    +-------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------------+
*** Subnetting
    Subnetting takes the classfull network allocated and reserves some
    host-bits to make internal networks.

    Lets say you have a Class-A network 8.0.0.0. Class A means the first 8
    bits name the network externally -- in this case, the "8" grouping.

    00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000

    The remaining 24 bits are allocated towards naming hosts on the network.
    Alternatively, you could instead reserve bits from the host address towards
    private networks. For example: lets say you wanted to divide it into two
    networks. You could reserve one bit of the host portion to create a subnet
    mask of:
    
    11111111 10000000 00000000 00000000

    Using this mask, you would have two networks: 8.0.0.0 and 8.128.0.0. Each
    bit allocated to the subnet id provides 2**N subnets, with each subnet providing
    2**(32-N-network bits) - 2 addresses (The two addresses each name the network ID and
    broadcast address, respectively).
*** Broadcast address
    A broadcast address is an address that allows all hosts to receive the
    datagram, assuming a host has not disabled this functionality. The broadcast address
    is formed by taking the network portion of the IP address and OR it with the
    compliment of the subnet mask. 

    If the subnet mask is 11111111 10000000 00000000 00000000 (255.128.0.0),
    the compliment is     00000000 01111111 11111111 11111111 (0.127.255.255).
    If the address is     00001000 00000000 00000000 00000001 (8.0.0.1)
    with the subnet mask above,
    then the broadcast is 00001000 01111111 11111111 11111111 (8.127.255.255).
*** Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)                         :important:
    In the '90s, we realized that networks would be exhausted at some point in
    the near future give the classful scheme of the day. Additionally, the
    more networks being allocated, the heavier the global routing table got.

    To address this, internet routing was extended to support
    *Classless Inter-Domain Routing*, or *CIDR*. CIDR allows for allocating
    networks containing more tahn 255 hosts but fewer than 65,536. With CIDR,
    an address range isn't a part of a class, but instead includes a CIDR mask,
    like a subnet mask or a *prefix*. The upshot of this is that we could make
    finer-grained network allocations.
*** Aggregation
    Aggregation is a method to keep the routing table of the internet small. To do this,
    routes that were adjacent are combined per router into a larger prefix. For example:

    consider networks 190.154.27.0/26, 190.154.27.64/26, and 190.154.27.192/26.

    - .0 and .64 are adjacent networks (a /26 contains 64 addresses), and so can
    be aggregated to *190.154.27.0/25*. 
    - 190.154.27.0/25 is not adjacent to 190.154.27.192/26, so an adjacent route
    190.154.27.128/26 is added to consideration and combined with .192 for
    190.154.27.128/25.
    - 190.154.27.0/25 and 190.154.27.128/25 are adjacent and combine to 190.154.27.0/24.
    - This can further be combined with 190.154.26.0/24 to create aggregate route
      109.154.26.0/23, covering the whole address space.
